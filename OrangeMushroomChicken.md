# Orange Mushroom Chicken 🍊🍗
Today I bring you another recipe that started off as an experiment! I am just beginning to get back into shape after all those lazy months in quarantine!🏃🏽‍♂️ Being the gym rat 🐭 that I am, I wanted something high in protein without excess calories, which would fill me up without compromising the taste! 
Thus came the idea of using all the excess orange juice as a sauce! I just had to be VERY careful to make sure I got the sauce right! 😋
### So, here it is! A quick, easy, delicious meal for all the fellow gym bros out there! 💪🏾
#### Ingredients 👨🏾‍🍳

- Teriyaki Sauce (Kikkoman)
- Rice Wine (14.5% alc.)
- Maple Syrup (Kirkland)
- Red Chilli Flakes (Kirkland)

2. To it, add 3 tablespoons of Teriyaki Sauce, and two tablespoons of rice wine.
3. Finally, add 3 tablespoons of Maple Syrup, and Red Chilli flakes and Sesame seeds per taste.
###### The sauce is now done! Let's stir well and keep it aside! 😁
##### The Main Dish
1. Take a pan, and put in a teaspoon of ghee (or alternatives), and add in the garlic bulbs, finely chopped.
2. Add in the chopped mushrooms and halved brussels sprouts! 🍄
3. In a separate pan, put in 1 lb of Extra Lean Ground Chicken. 
4. Cook the chicken thoroughly until brown, but not fully cooked! 🐓
5. Then, once the chicken is brown, mix the contents of the two pans together, and add in the sauce.
6. Keep the heat to low, and put a lid on the pan!
##### And now, the longest step, the wait... 🥺 Turn the heat off after 5 minutes of cooking and frequent stirring (once per two minutes). Wait 5 more minutes to let the dish cool down... and enjoy! 😋
