# Wine Marinated Salmon Fillets 🐟
### Perhaps my favourite recipe of all time!
I started this recipe as an experiment. My dad is not particularly fond of fish and was apprehensive about getting some salmon for dinner. So, I set out to show him that salmon can be an excellent choice for a meal!
**This dish requires some patience, so make sure you keep that in mind!👨🏾‍🍳**
So, let's get started! This recipe is prepared in two steps and requires the following ingredients:
- Fresh Salmon Fillets (skin removed)
- Olive Oil, Canola Oil, or Ghee (Any one of them)
- Peri Peri Sauce (Nando's); Medium
- Teriyaki Sauce (Kikkoman)
- Rice Wine (14.5% alc.)
- Worcestershire Sauce (Lea and Perrins)
- Maple Syrup (Kirkland)
- Two thin slices of lemon, with peel intact

#### Step 1 - The Marination 😋
- Get some fresh salmon fillets! Personally, I get my fillets from Oceans. They get fresh meat every morning! 🥩
- Obtain the following sauces:
  - Peri Peri Sauce (Nando's); Medium
  - Teriyaki Sauce (Kikkoman)
  - Rice Wine (14.5% alc.)
  - Worcestershire Sauce (Lea and Perrins)
  - Maple Syrup (Kirkland)
- Per 1 lb fillet, mix 6 tablespoons of rice wine with 4 tablespoons of teriyaki sauce and 1 tablespoon of worcestershire sauce.
- This should create a mixture with a strong smell.
- Put the fillets in a bowl and pour in the mixture! Move them around to make sure the coat is uniform.
- Refrigerate this bowl for 18 hours, flipping the orientation of fillet every 9 hours.

#### Step 2 - The Cooking 🤩
- Create the cooking sauce by mixing equal parts of peri peri sauce and maple syrup. We will be adding this to the marinade when we get to cooking with it!
- Take a pan large enough to hold the fillets. Heat up to medium heat.
- Put in one teaspoon of the cooking oil of your choice (three alternatives listed above).
- Once hot, put in the fillets. Watch out for the splashes, they might be hot! 😛
- Make sure you flip the fillets periodically, we don't want them to burn! 
- About 5 minutes into cooking the fillets, dial down the heat to low, and add in the marinade + peri peri + maple syrup mixture!
- Throw in the slices of lemon 🍋 The purpose of keeping the peel intact is for it to impart the unique taste of the peel to the sauce and the fish! 
- Continue to cook until the fillets are thoroughly cooked! Towards the end, pour one tablespoon of teriyaki sauce on the fillet, and turn it over.

#### Oops, there is a step 3... Let's eat! 😜

The reason I differentiated the marinade and the cooking sauce was so that I could create a contrast of tastes within the salmon fillet. The reason I love salmon so much is because it is very good at being able to absorb the taste of the marinade. With rice wine and teriyaki sauce as the marinade, the taste will surely pack a punch!😋

In addition to that, the cooking sauce had a sweet n' spicy texture to provide a contrast to the kick the rice wine packed. The result - salmon fillet that is sweet and spicy on the outside, but packs the punch of alcohol as you chew into its soft and mellow texture! 🤤
