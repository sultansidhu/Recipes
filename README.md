# Recipes
Cooking is one of my favourite ways to pass the time. I developed a "taste" (get it? 😛) during the quarantine. I started off with following recipes off of the internet, and trying to add my own twists to them! 👨🏾‍🍳

At first, my dishes tasted like compressed cardboard 🥲 Fortunately though, through practice and patience, I was able to get better! Now, my family thinks that my dishes being edible is a safer bet! 😂 

I have personally taste tested all of the creations listed in this repository! I can vouch for their deliciousness, and rate myself 5/5 😜

Feel free to try these dishes out. Whenever you do, let me know what you think!
